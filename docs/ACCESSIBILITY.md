# Memory Lane - Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview

Accessibility is a core principle of Memory Lane's design philosophy, working hand-in-hand with our focus on reduced cognitive load. This document outlines our approach to creating an inclusive note-taking experience that works for all users, regardless of ability. We prioritize two key areas:

1. **Voice Input**: Enabling hands-off memory creation
2. **Screen Reader Optimization**: Ensuring the app works seamlessly with assistive technologies

## Voice Input Implementation

### Core Voice Functionality

- **Always-Available Voice Input**: Accessible from any screen via a persistent button or voice command
- **Complete Voice Control**: All app functions navigable and executable via voice
- **Contextual Commands**: Intelligent understanding of commands based on current app state
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Voice interface designed to minimize mental effort and decisions

### Voice Input Specifications

#### Unified Note Type

- **Trigger Phrases**: "New note", "Create note", "Start recording", "Remember this"
- **Content Capture**: Continuous recording with automatic punctuation and formatting
- **Command Recognition**: Special keywords for formatting and note organization
- **Metadata Commands**: Support for adding tags, categories, and importance markers by voice
- **Mode Selection**: Automatic detection of appropriate capture mode based on content and context

### Voice Processing

- **On-Device Processing**: Primary voice recognition happens on-device for privacy and speed
- **Error Correction**: Intelligent suggestion system for misheard words
- **Confirmation Feedback**: Verbal and visual confirmation of actions taken
- **Training Option**: Voice recognition that improves with usage

### Accessibility Considerations for Voice

- **Multiple Voice Profiles**: Support for different speech patterns and accents
- **Speech Rate Adaptation**: Accommodates different speaking speeds and patterns
- **Noise Filtering**: Enhanced processing for noisy environments
- **Alternative Input Fallback**: Seamless transition to text input when voice isn't practical

## Screen Reader Optimization

### Timeline View Accessibility

- **Semantic Structure**:
  - Header with app title properly marked as heading
  - View selector tabs properly grouped with ARIA roles
  - Each note card is a distinct, focusable element with proper heading structure
  - Location information properly associated with each note

- **Focus Order**:
  - Logical tab order: header elements → view selector → note cards (in chronological order) → bottom navigation
  - Within each card: title → content preview → metadata (time, location)

- **Announcements**:
  - Card titles announced as headings
  - Relative timestamps announced (e.g., "created 2 minutes ago")
  - Location information announced with location name
  - Bottom navigation elements clearly labeled

- **Actions**:
  - Custom actions for each card (open, favorite, share)
  - Clear announcement when activating the new note button

### Note Editor Accessibility

- **Semantic Structure**:
  - Close, Draft, and Save buttons properly labeled
  - Title and content fields with proper labels and roles
  - Formatting toolbar properly grouped with accessible labels
  - Location and tags sections with proper headings and associations

- **Focus Order**:
  - Logical tab order: close button → action buttons → title field → content field → formatting options → location → tags → bottom toolbar
  - Formatting toolbar follows a logical left-to-right order

- **Announcements**:
  - Clear state changes when formatting is applied
  - Location updates announced
  - Tag additions/removals announced
  - Save/Draft status changes announced

- **Actions**:
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common formatting actions
  - Voice commands for all editor functions
  - Clear error messages for any validation issues

### Structural Optimization
