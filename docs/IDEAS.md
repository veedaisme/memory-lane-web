# Memory Lane - Feature Ideas

## Enhanced Note Features that Align with Core Principles

After reviewing the design document and researching current best practices in note-taking applications, here are several features worth implementing for the create, update, and delete note operations that align with Memory Lane's core principles:

## 1. Progressive Disclosure in Note Creation

**How it works**: Start with a minimal interface showing only the essentials (content field, save button), but progressively reveal more options as the user engages with the note.

**Aligns with**: 
- Reduced Cognitive Load (presents only what's needed at first)
- Minimalism with Purpose (maintains clean interface without sacrificing functionality)

**Implementation**: The floating modal could start very simple, then expand to reveal formatting options, tags, etc. as the user begins typing or interacts with it.

## 2. Contextual Smart Defaults

**How it works**: Pre-fill note fields based on context:
- Meeting notes if during a calendar appointment time
- Shopping list if at a grocery store
- Reading notes if opened from an article or book app

**Aligns with**:
- Context-Awareness (leverages situational data)
- Reduced Cognitive Load (anticipates user needs)

## 3. Rich Media Quick-Capture

**How it works**: Enable capturing images, voice notes, or sketches directly into notes with minimal friction. Single tap/gesture to add different media types.

**Aligns with**:
- Accessibility (supports multiple input methods)
- Reduced Cognitive Load (capture thoughts in their most natural form)

## 4. Soft Delete with Graceful Recovery

**How it works**: Instead of permanent deletion, move notes to an archive with a simple recovery option. Show recently archived notes in a separate section that fades over time.

**Aligns with**:
- Reduced Cognitive Load (eliminates worry about permanent deletion)
- Delight Through Motion (graceful animation for archiving/restoring)

## 5. Inline AI Assistance

**How it works**: Subtle AI assistance that can:
- Suggest titles based on content
- Recommend related tags
- Offer to clean up formatting or grammar
- Help expand brief notes into more detailed ones

**Aligns with**:
- Reduced Cognitive Load (offloads refinement tasks)
- Minimalism (assistance appears contextually, not constantly)

## 6. Version History Timeline

**How it works**: Visual timeline showing the evolution of a note, allowing users to see how their thoughts developed over time or revert to previous versions.

**Aligns with**:
- Context-Awareness (preserves the journey of ideas)
- Accessibility (reduces memory demands)

## 7. Gesture-Based Controls

**How it works**: Implement intuitive gestures for common actions:
- Swipe down to save and close
- Swipe left/right to navigate between notes
- Pinch to minimize or expand the note modal

**Aligns with**:
- Delight Through Motion (satisfying interactions)
- Accessibility (alternative to button-based controls)

## 8. Focus Mode

**How it works**: One-tap option that dims everything except the note content, creating a distraction-free writing environment within the modal.

**Aligns with**:
- Minimalism with Purpose (eliminates visual noise when deep focus is needed)
- Reduced Cognitive Load (removes distractions)

## 9. Smart Connections Panel

**How it works**: A subtle indicator showing related notes that appears only after the user has finished initial writing. Tapping reveals connections without leaving the current note.

**Aligns with**:
- Context-Awareness (builds on the Memory Lane Graph concept)
- Minimalism (doesn't interrupt the creation flow)

## 10. Ambient Context Capture

**How it works**: Subtly capture contextual metadata beyond just location:
- Weather conditions
- Time of day
- Ambient noise level
- Activity (if permissions allow)

**Aligns with**:
- Context-Awareness (enriches notes with situational data)
- Reduced Cognitive Load (automatic context without manual entry)

## Implementation Priority

Based on alignment with core principles and implementation complexity, recommended priorities:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - High impact, relatively simple to implement
2. **Soft Delete with Recovery** - Addresses user anxiety about deletions
3. **Gesture-Based Controls** - Enhances the modal experience
4. **Inline AI Assistance** - Leverages existing AI infrastructure 
5. **Focus Mode** - Simple to implement with high value for users
